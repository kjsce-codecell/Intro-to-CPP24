    // please just dont be confused between >> and << we use >> in cin

    cin >> b;
    //see how we here took string as an input same way you can take it in char

    cout << a << " " << b << endl;
    // cout << is use for printing the value into the console
    // unlike python in default line does not break you need to manually do it
    // " " is given because to provide space between the outputs
    // there are 2 ways \n and endl here \n is faster
